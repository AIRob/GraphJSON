GraphJSON
=========

All of the GraphJSON file format and specifications are located [here](wiki)

There are a number of different graph file formats - GEXF, GDF, GML, .csv, Pajek Net, GraphML, etc.  For web based graph applications, a standardized graph format is needed, similar to GeoJSON, so that applications can automatically render graphs with pre-specified layouts, visualization layers, colors, and other attributes.

GraphJSON v0.1 is simple array of Nodes and Edges format.  Future specifications will include a number of new features, including layout, styling, and interactions.

Find an example GraphJSON file [here](examples/data/bacon.json).
